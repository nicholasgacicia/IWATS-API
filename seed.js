    "shownotes": "Trey, Mike, Fish, and Jeff Holdsworth recall being billed as &ldquo;Blackwood Convention&rdquo; for this show (though no one is certain what band name was used), which is believed to be their first public gig together. The band was short on equipment, so a hockey stick was used as a microphone stand. Between sets, the DJ spun some Michael Jackson and Trey drummed along to the album. The house music (which included more Michael Jackson) was presumably turned up after Fire to drown out the band. The setlist may be incomplete, though, as the master recording contains nothing after Trey&rsquo;s sarcastic comments about Michael Jackson following Fire. All songs were, of course, Phish debuts. Back in Black was teased before Scarlet Begonias. While this show is often billed as an ROTC Halloween Dance that took place on October 30, 1983, this is incorrect. The master copy of the recording of this show, as unearthed by Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro, contains a handwritten note that pegs the date as December 2, 1983. In discussions with Kevin, band members confirmed that they recall rehearsing for this show over the Thanksgiving Break, and that the show was a Christmas semi-formal. Also, it was not an ROTC-sponsored event; it was a dorm dance in a predominantly ROTC dorm (Mike&rsquo;s dorm at the time).",

A set break was announced after Ya Mar, so this is the complete first set. The songs listed as in the second set are believed to have been performed in that set, though it is unknown whether more songs were also performed in the second set, and if there was a third set as well. This show featured the first known performances of The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday, Divided Sky, Harpua, and Bundle of Joy,&nbsp;as well as the first known Phish performance of Avenu Malkenu.&nbsp;The keyword for Makisupa was &quot;Woke up in the morning, dioxin on my head / Woke up in the afternoon Gaddafi in my bed.&quot;",

All Blues was played for the first time since April 15, 1986 (110&nbsp;shows). During Antelope, Trey told the story of what happened to Fish&nbsp;that evening and explained that Fish, who had been at the top of a mountain and, therefore, late for the gig, had to &ldquo;Run like an Antelope, out of control.&rdquo; Elsewhere in the set, Trey chided Fish&nbsp;for his tardiness. The narration in Harpua was straightforward, with no teases. Anarchy was jokingly named Whipping Post. Terrapin featured a Fish&nbsp;trombone solo. Many recordings of this show in circulation have the venue mislabeled as Fly Me to the Moon Saloon.",

John Paluska and Ben Hunter, who were managing Phish at the time, therefore rented the room for the evening. John and Ben promoted the gig heavily, including via radio. Tickets were only $5. Tom Baggott, a fan of the band, helped get Burlington fans to the show by Greyhound bus. Not only did the gig sell out, but there were some 200 people shut out (mostly Boston University and Boston College students). I Didn&#39;t Know featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. Alumni contained additional lyrics. Prior to YEM, Trey welcomed his mom, who had come &quot;all the way from Ireland.&quot; After YEM, Trey said that they had a special guest that night for the person in the front row that kept requesting that they play Minkin. Trey mentioned that there was a Minkin hanging behind the band and that Minkin was also there that night. There was a subsequent brief Minkin vocal tease prior to Lizards. This version of Sanity was the fast version.",

    "shownotes": "This was a benefit for Goddard&rsquo;s sculpture building and marked the first known performance of Kung. The band&rsquo;s Halloween costumes included Trey wearing devil horns, latex pants, and strap-on breasts (which he ran around fondling during Ninja Custodian&rsquo;s set) and Mike wearing a dog-faced mask. The band distributed boxes of macaroni and cheese for audience use during the Bowie intro. This Bowie, at over 20 minutes, was, at the time, one of the longest versions ever. During the pause in Letter to Jimmy Page, Trey wished happy birthday to &quot;Mary Ellen.&quot; Lizards contained an <em>I Dream of Jeannie</em> theme&nbsp;tease from Page. The show closed with Trey returning to the Kung theme, as he promised to stage another runaway golf cart marathon this time next year. Ninja Custodian was the opening act.",

Adding to the confusion was an explosion on or near the stage during David Bowie (possibly a flash pot or fireworks) which pushed the crowd over the edge. The show was cut short when the house lights were turned on and bouncers quickly evacuated everybody from the venue. The source of these show notes is phish.com.",

    "shownotes": "After Reba, the crowd was chanting &quot;cheeseburger.&quot; Fish and Trey subsequently went into a rap about burgers. Trey dedicated Forbin&#39;s to the Colonial (Bruce Hampton). Forbin&#39;s was then performed with a variety of lyric substitutions of Col. (Bruce) Hampton for Col Forbin. Rocky Top through Antelope featured the &ldquo;Reverend&rdquo; Jeff Mosier on banjo; Antelope also featured Oteil Burbridge on bass. As Fish&nbsp;took the stage during HYHU, the crowd chanted for Fee. Fish sounded perplexed and remarked that he doesn&rsquo;t sing Fee, but Trey and Page started the song up anyway and left Fish&nbsp;on the spot. He tried his best and got through the first verse before falling apart during the chorus. Terrapin featured Fish&nbsp;on trombone. The band said &quot;Fee&quot; several times at that start of Possum, which contained subsequent Blue Monk teases from Trey and a Rhapsody in Blue tease from Page. BBFCFM contained an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. The source of Set I is phish.com.",

    "shownotes": "It is unconfirmed whether Fire closed the first set or was even performed at all. Trey referred to HYHU as the &ldquo;Henrietta Theme Song.&rdquo; After Page played several measures of the second HYHU in the setlist, Fish said &ldquo;There&rsquo;s one more verse to this,&rdquo; and then they played the final verse of Love You. Fish also continued to play vacuum during the third and final HYHU of the set, which also featured Trey repeating &ldquo;Henrietta!&rdquo; over and over again, singing it along to the music&rsquo;s conclusion. In response to a fan requesting more Syd Barrett after the last HYHU, Fish spoke the first few words of Bike. Trey teased Call to the Post before YEM (as Fish was returning to his drum kit after HYHU). Before Contact, Fish said &ldquo;We would like to perform for you now the bass-player-is-taking-a-leak-song.&rdquo; Fish then dedicated Contact to Paul Languedoc. Also before Contact, Page told the crowd that their bass player (whom Trey then referred to as &ldquo;Michael Cactin&rdquo;) would become 25 years old at midnight. Trey added that Mike would now play everyone a love song.",

    "shownotes": "This show was Phish&#39;s first public gig in New Jersey and featured many references to the state. Trey started the show by saying he was born and raised in New Jersey. Before Uncle Pen, Trey said that this was sort of a dream come true for him and Page, who grew up in New Jersey, adding it was the first time they&#39;d ever played in the state. &nbsp;Trey said &quot;we&#39;ll do a little song here that brings us back to our New Jersey roots here... it&#39;s an old Bill Monroe song.&quot; Mike added that it was &quot;a song about Pendleton Vandiver, Bill Monroe&#39;s uncle. It&#39;s true. He&#39;s dead.&quot; Stash was played by request for &quot;Big Phil&quot; Muller, and was preceded by Fish&nbsp;playing the <em>Charlie Chan</em> signal. Fish&nbsp;said &quot;he wrote it,&quot; Trey said &quot;probably because I wrote it,&quot; and Mike added &quot;I think it sucks. Essentially.&quot; Regarding Stash, Trey said &quot;I collaborated on this song writing the music end of it and the lyrics were written by another native New Jerseyian, Tom Marshall, who isn&#39;t here tonight, unfortunately, because he&#39;s gotta be at work tomorrow programming computers.&quot; Fish&nbsp;added &quot;for his dad&quot; and Trey responded &quot;My dad, he works for my dad. Keeping it all in the family here.&quot; Stash and La Grange contained Buried Alive teases. Prior to Landlady, Trey said they were going to play it in honor of their first gig in New Jersey. Mike introduced Destiny Unbound as a song he wrote about his Uncle Pendleton Vandiver. Prior to Buried Alive, Trey asked for a show of hands from the sparse crowd as to how many people in the room were actually from New Jersey and said &quot;we&#39;re going to play a song that we wrote that we think captures the spirit of New Jersey,&quot; calling it &quot;New Jersey And You, Perfect Together,&quot; which is the state&#39;s tourism slogan (a joke he later referenced in Golgi and Contact). Trey encouraged the crowd to &quot;sing along when the chorus comes, just like it&#39;s a big commercial, because we&#39;ll be filming this for the next New Jersey commercial.&quot; During I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey introduced Fish&nbsp;as &quot;Zero Man&quot; and the song&#39;s lyrics were changed to Pardon Me &quot;Zero Man.&quot; Before Contact, Trey introduced his dog Marley as &quot;the 5th member of the band who doesn&#39;t usually get as much recognition... and we&#39;re going to play Marley&#39;s favorite song -- at this moment in time.&quot;",

The Mango Song was played for the first time since September&nbsp;16, 1989 (182&nbsp;shows), though Trey curiously introduced it as being &ldquo;new.&rdquo; The second set was cut short due to Brown University&rsquo;s curfew; after Cavern, a representative from Brown (Trey: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to tell them, <em>you </em>tell them!&rdquo;) informed the crowd that the show had to end by midnight and that the next song had to be the last. During a pause in Letter to Jimmy Page, Trey noted: &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going to forget that this got cut short, and the next time we&rsquo;re back in the area we&rsquo;re going to make it up to you.&rdquo; Before the hasty encore Trey remarked: &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to have to watch out for the &lsquo;big hook!&#39;&rdquo;",

The &ldquo;artillery&rdquo; was Fish&rsquo;s new vacuum, which made its debut at this show. Fish noted that &ldquo;if I bleed during this song, that&rsquo;ll just be part of the effects.&rdquo; Inspired by his new instrument, Fish took an exceedingly spacey solo during Terrapin, complete with ersatz wolf howls, before singing the final verse <em>through </em>the vacuum.",

    "shownotes": "This show featured some great stage banter. Brother was dedicated to &ldquo;the guy who offered us $10,000 to play a different song.&rdquo; In the HYHU intro, Fish&nbsp;said &ldquo;I hate this fucking song,&rdquo; that the only reason the band plays the song is because he hates it and added &ldquo;All I have do in this band is say I hate something, and it&rsquo;ll be done forever.&rdquo; Trey told the crowd that HYHU is the Henrietta theme precisely because Fish hates it. &ldquo;It used to be &lsquo;La Bamba,&rsquo;&rdquo; he noted, prompting Mike to play a bit of La Bamba. The HYHU outro featured Fish on trombone and later telling the crowd &quot;you paid for this, this is what you bought.&quot; Trey said &quot;If you only knew what a nightmare that was for poor Fish, having to listen to that song&quot; and Fish responded with &ldquo;they just do it out of HATE.&rdquo; Trey asked who could tell him who wrote that song, and a fan answered correctly. Trey said the fan won the $10,000 the other guy was going to give them to a play a song and Page said the fan won a date with Fish, with Trey adding &quot;and you can guarantee that he&#39;ll be late.&quot; After Golgi, Trey thanked the crowd, saying &quot;we&#39;ll be right back with more songs that Fish hates, more songs that we love, and more songs that people are willing to pay $10,000 to hear.&quot; Trey introduced Page as Leon before his piano solos in My Sweet One and Rocky Top. Before Fish&#39;s trombone solo in I Didn&#39;t Know, Trey mentioned the last time they played in the area (see 4/11/91), they made Fish get up and tell a joke (The Prison Joke) that was &quot;absolutely the stupidest joke ever&quot; and that he (Trey) wasn&#39;t going tell the punchline. Trey went on to explain that most people around here thought Fish was a pretty bad joke teller and he wanted to give him a chance to redeem himself.&nbsp; Fish&#39;s joke was &quot;Why did the Siamese twins go to England? To let the other one drive for a while.&quot; Page also teased HYHU while Trey talked. Adeline was sung from the balcony without microphones to open the encore. Possum contained two <em>Charlie Chan</em> signals as well as Simpsons and Random Laugh signals in its intro and subsequently contained Rock On (David Essex) teases.",

Divided Sky, Antelope and Weekapaug featured teases of Those Were the Days, and Antelope also contained a Lizards tease from Trey and an All Fall Down signal. Trey sang the verses of Fee through a megaphone for the first time since October 1, 1990&nbsp;(268 shows). Phish originals Axilla, Fast Enough for You, and Lengthwise debuted at this show, which also featured the Phish debut of I Walk The Line. The start of the second set included an Owner of a Lonely Heart tease. Mike&rsquo;s Song included an Under Pressure jam as well as an Axilla tease from Mike. Weekapaug was unfinished, included a vocal jam, and ended with a tease (with lyrics) of The&nbsp;Price of Love. Tweezer contained an I Walk The Line tease. The BBFCFM jam did not contain the song&#39;s usual lyrics - it instead featured lyrics from both I Walk The Line and Ring of Fire, as well as a brief Ring of Fire tease (from Page). Big Ball Jam also debuted, with Trey explaining the concept of the song, adding that it was written for Pete Schall. Poor Heart, Fast Enough for You and Llama featured Gordon Stone on pedal steel guitar. Trey introduced Fish as &ldquo;Eyeball Man&rdquo; before Lengthwise, which was performed in more of a reggae style than other versions and even featured a vacuum solo from Fish. After Lengthwise, Page said Fish wrote the song, with Trey adding that they liked it so much that it appeared twice on the album and both Page and Trey saying &quot;it&#39;s that good.&quot; The intro to Cavern contained Axilla teases from Trey. Bold As Love was played for the first time since April 18, 1990 (317 shows).</p>\r\n",

In typical Phish fashion, to make the most of this opportunity, flyers were handed out to fans walking into the show that stated that the band had come up with a bunch of new &#39;language&#39; signals designed to confuse the average radio listener. The signals would be written on signs and held up by Trey at various times throughout the night. The&nbsp;handout explained each signal. Wilson included a Simpsons signal, I Didn&#39;t Know contained a Yay/Boo signal, Antelope included a Random Note signal, the Mockingbird narration included a Mass Hysteria signal, and Harpua included a Lip-Flop signal. Wilson and the end of Divided Sky contained <em>Jeopardy!</em> teases from Page and Antelope contained an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Brad Sands was hoisted above the crowd as The Famous Mockingbird (in a chicken&nbsp;costume) during the Mockingbird narration (about being taken underwater and turned into stone). The narration also contained&nbsp;teases of &quot;Charge!&quot; and the theme to <em>Star Trek</em> from Page. This was the first time that Mike&rsquo;s and Weekapaug were played without Hydrogen in the middle as the band treated the audience to a fantastic New Year&rsquo;s transition. The Mike&rsquo;s combo included Trey counting down to the New Year and telling the crowd that they better make the last minute of the year a good one. Kung was played for the first time since November 2, 1989 (414&nbsp;shows). This show featured the Phish debut (and only appearance) of Diamond Girl, which featured The Dude of Life on vocals. Dressed as an old man, The Dude entered and exited the stage pushing a lawnmower. Carolina was performed without amplification.",

Band interviews and the <em>Hoist</em> version of Julius were interspersed between the live performances. Highlights of the interview included the announcement that the three-show Beacon Theatre run sold out in 33 minutes; Trey commenting that he had locked up both his skis and his motorcycle for fear of having a pre-tour accident and then ended up breaking his foot by stumbling into a hole on the side of the stage during rehearsals; the band joking about having been approached by Snapple fruit juices for a &ldquo;Snapple in a Jar&rdquo; campaign; and discussion of the Disease video (which prompted Dennis to ask them to play the song). At the beginning of Disease, Trey told Mike to &ldquo;write it down brotha,&rdquo; which became a running gag throughout the first half of the song. Trey continued repeating the phrase, causing him to laugh through the lyrics of the first verse and humorously fumble the lyrics at the beginning of the second verse.</p>\r\n",

Possum also included an L.A. Woman tease. Before Guyute, Trey teased Spill the Wine. This epic Bowie, which times out at nearly 34 minutes, included whistling and a &ldquo;Lassie&rdquo; chant, a brief 2001 tease from Mike, and a whistled tease of Fishin&#39; Hole. GTBT included Heartbreaker and Stairway to Heaven teases. My Long Journey Home was performed acoustic. The soundcheck&#39;s Sample was only one verse.

    "shownotes": "Trey played along to Gary Glitter&rsquo;s Rock and Roll Part 2, which was being played over the P.A., at the start of the first set. Antelope featured guest vocals from Tom Marshall. Divided Sky contained a brief Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Mike&rsquo;s Song included a Shine tease and Weekapaug contained a Can&#39;t You Hear Me Knocking tease as well as an Auld Lang Syne tease from Trey. Slave contained Crimes of the Mind teases. Before the lights went out for the third set, the audience &ldquo;overheard&rdquo; the band before the set. Fish wound up saying &ldquo;I want a jumbo hot dog, large fries and shake&rdquo; delivered on stage. The band came out, started up My Sweet One, and was interrupted by an announcer asking who ordered the food. The band pointed at Fish, who looked confused as huge props of a hot dog, fries and shakes descended from the ceiling next to the drum set. The band played 2001 while the hot dog landed. The James Bond Theme was then broadcast over the PA while technicians (wearing &ldquo;Rocket Scientist&rdquo; jackets) prepared the hot dog, and the band climbed in with their instruments and flew out over the audience, as balloons popped and feathers, confetti and &ldquo;Phish NYE 1994&rdquo; ping pong balls fell from the ceiling. Various music, including the Captain Beefheart song Tropical Hot Dog Night, was played over the P.A. as the hot dog space ship flew back and forth. Mike&#39;s maternal grandmother, Lillian Cherry, joined the band on stage for Chalk Dust with a shoe in her hand.&nbsp;This version of Bouncing appears on <em>A Live One</em>.",

Fish introduced the new songs that had been played before Lonesome Cowboy Bill. Fish explained that they didn&#39;t really have a name for the song after Ha Ha Ha and Trey added that since it was a Voters For Choice Benefit, they&#39;d give the crowd four choices and let it vote on the title: The Plane, The First Single, Israel, and Spock&#39;s Brain. Page subsequently teased the theme from <em>Star Trek </em>as the crowd voted for Spock&#39;s with Trey subsequently explaining the song&#39;s origin. Prior to Adeline, the crowd sang Happy Birthday to Page.",

    "shownotes": "Harpua included a story from Mike about a dream about raccoons. The Michael Jackson references continued, as Trey teased the audience by saying that Jimmy was listening to the Halloween album while the band played a Beat It tease. Also, the second set was preceded by recorded Wanna Be Startin&#39; Somethin&#39; and Thriller teases from Michael Jackson&#39;s <em>Thriller </em>album. The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was The Who&#39;s <em>Quadrophenia</em> and was performed with Dave Grippo on alto saxophone, Don Glasgo on trombone, Joey Sommerville on trumpet and Alan Parshley on French horn. During Bell Boy, crew member Leigh Fordham, clad in a bell boy outfit, sang Keith Moon&rsquo;s original part. All of the <em>Quadrophenia</em> songs, as well as My Generation, were Phish debuts. YEM was almost 40 minutes long, contained teases from Trey of The Real Me and DEG, and was preceded by the audience chess move. The chosen fan, dressed as a Wookiee, cracked under the pressure and could not choose a move on stage, prompting a quote from Fish that &ldquo;Wookiees can&rsquo;t play chess.&rdquo; The Rock was teased after the failed move. Jesus Just Left Chicago featured Grippo on alto saxophone; Suzy Greenberg featured Grippo, Glasgo and Somerville. My Generation was performed acoustic. Before My Generation, the crew set up a Keith Moon replica drum set on stage. After the song, Fish&nbsp;and Trey destroyed the drum set a la The Who. Finally, a stagehand brought out a large plunger. Trey pressed it and set off a huge explosion backstage. This show was officially released as <em>Live Phish 14</em>. In the soundcheck, Suzy Greenberg was performed three times: the first with only Grippo, the second with the band and Grippo, and the third with all of the horns, alternate lyrics, and Bell Boy quotes. The jam through the end of the soundcheck was played with horns.",

Tweezer included a Norwegian Wood jam. Harry Hood featured the debut of the &ldquo;Hood&rdquo; response chant, initiated by Phish.netters and advertised on flyers handed out at the Red Rocks shows. Among other ideas, the flyers encouraged fans to shout: &ldquo;Hood&rdquo; after the band sings &ldquo;Harry.&rdquo; It began to rain in the second set; the band responded with Purple Rain, and Chris Kuroda showed the stage in purple lights.

Tweezer had big trampolines on each side of the stage and more circus shenanigans. A stunt plane circled overhead during Tweezer Reprise and Harpua. Harpua was unfinished; it was completed on August 16, 1997 at The Great Went.",

The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was Talking Heads&#39; <em>Remain in Light. </em>All of the <em>Remain in Light</em> songs were Phish debuts; the set featured Karl Perazzo on percussion, Dave Grippo on saxophone, and Gary Gazaway on trumpet (except for Born Under Punches, which featured Gazaway on valve trombone). Perazzo also played during the entire third set. Jesus Just Left Chicago, Suzy Greenberg, and Frankenstein also featured Grippo and Gazaway. At the end of Houses in Motion (which featured Trey teasing Tweezer), an armchair was brought out to the center of the stage and Mike sat in it to sing Seen and Not Seen. While he sang, Karl Perazzo drummed and Trey played bass. After Overload (which featured Fish singing in front of the band and not on drums), a bizarre on-stage demonstration (including Fish on vacuum) closed the set. The third set opened with a Feel Like a Stranger tease. Suzy included a Born Under Punches tease from Page. Simple included a tease of Mama Told Me Not to Come. The soundcheck&#39;s Overload was performed with horns and briefly featured Fish&nbsp;on vacuum. This show was officially released as <em>Live Phish 15</em>.</p>\r\n",

The Art Jam saw the crowd carry the pieces of the band&rsquo;s art to the side of the venue where it was hoisted onto the Art Tower and added to the fans&#39; art. During Tweezer Reprise, the Art Tower was burned to the ground as The Great Went came to a close. As the Hood jam kicked in, Trey asked Chris to turn the lights off and the band jammed while the front section of the audience engaged in the first Hood glowstick war. Trey remarked to the crowd at the end of the jam that the visual display was cool. Between the first and second sets, the Bangor Symphony Orchestra performed selections from Stravinsky and Debussy as a red-smoke-spewing glider synchronized its swoops and dives to the music. Buffalo Bill was played for the first time since December 31, 1994 (204 shows).",

The 11:00 a.m. announcement was that tickets would be sold at noon the vacant Pier 32, prompting a mad rush of fans to the waterfront. Of the several thousand who arrived, roughly four hundred lucky people were able to buy vouchers entitling them to a pair of tickets. Prior to Brian and Robert, Trey said that Fish used to hate the yellow light and that Fish used to have a list of things that he hated, adding that every time they found out something Fish hated, they&#39;d always do it (prompting Page to tease HYHU, which Fish also hates). Fish added that he hated the vowel &quot;ooo&quot; (the crowd responded with &quot;ooo&quot; noises). Trey said the only way to overcome something you hate was to face it head on. Trey then had Chris Kuroda shine a yellow light on Fish for Brian and Robert.&nbsp;Reba did not have the whistling ending. Hood contained a tease of Aaron Copland&rsquo;s Fanfare for the Common Man. After the show, some fans were given a poster (later for sale from Phish Dry Goods) and a bumper sticker (saying: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just come from Phish at the Fillmore. It was nice.&rdquo;).",

The band counted the crowd into the New Year before busting into Auld Lang Syne.&nbsp;While some fans used the glowrings to start a Glowstick War during Hood, others used them to create long chain links of rings spanning the venue from end to end.",

    "shownotes": "This was the second show of the Big Cypress festival. Fish was introduced as &#39;Soda Jerk&#39; during I&nbsp;Didn&rsquo;t Know.&nbsp;Split Open and Melt&nbsp;and Disease were unfinished. Melt contained A Love Supreme teases.&nbsp;After the ensuing Catapult, Trey remarked: &ldquo;Only at the largest concert in the world could we get away with playing a song like that.&rdquo; After Midnight made its Phish debut. The late set, also known as &ldquo;The Show,&rdquo; began at around 11:35. &ldquo;Father Time&rdquo; was on stage, pedaling on an exercise bike that powered a large clock. The sounds of the clock&rsquo;s gears could be heard through the sound system. About ten minutes before midnight, &ldquo;Father Time&rdquo; collapsed from exhaustion and the clock stopped. Then, a large fan boat entered the concert field and approached the stage. Early in its journey, the fan boat exploded away and revealed the hot dog used in the 1994 New Year&rsquo;s stunt. While the band rode the hot dog to the stage, an instrumental version of Meatstick began to play over the P.A.. The band reached the stage and fed several meatsticks to Father Time, reviving him so that the clock could continue moving toward midnight. The band then took the stage and played Meatstick to begin The Show. Dancers were on stage prior to Phish reaching it. Auld Lang Syne and Disease were accompanied by fireworks.&nbsp;Heavy Things was recorded live and rebroadcast as part of ABC television&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve coverage. In a humorous effort to confuse the home audience, Trey instructed the crowd to yell the word &ldquo;cheesecake&rdquo; in lieu of cheering at the end of the song. After twice giving the example of yelling the word once, Trey changed his mind and instructed the crowd to chant it, adding for them to say it like they were pissed. Trey then introduced the band for the rebroadcast and offered a message of peace and harmony for the world where he reminded people to drive in the right lane unless passing another vehicle. Meatstick was subsequently teased as the New Year approached in the central time zone. Crosseyed included a DEG tease. YEM included a vocal jam based around the word &ldquo;cheesecake&rdquo; and Trey altered the lyrics to Axilla and Albuquerque to reference the word. Inlaw Josie Wales featured Trey on acoustic guitar. Quadrophonic Toppling debuted, albeit with different music than on <em>The Siket Disc,&nbsp;</em>and included My Soul teasing from Mike. Rock and Roll included an After Midnight tease. Love You included band introductions; Fish&nbsp;introduced Page before the song and Mike and Trey afterwards, and the band as &ldquo;Phish 2000&rdquo; (see November 2, 1990). Piper contained Bug teases from Page. 2001 began with the signature Hood drum roll. After the show closed with yet another version of Meatstick, the Beatles song Here Comes the Sun was piped through the crowd at sunrise. Two breakouts were played: Crosseyed and Painless (first since August 13, 1997, or 159 shows), and Love You (first since July 5, 1997, or 179 shows).",

Funky Bitch and My Soul were performed as a warm-up before the show went on the air, although the crowd was already in the bar. Jibboo through Heavy Things were aired live on the show (except for Magilla, which was played during a commercial break). Magilla was played for the first time since August 1, 1998 (107 shows). The band briefly jammed on the <em>Jeopardy!</em> theme (with the crowd providing some vocals) during a radio break, although this is not included on any circulating recordings.&nbsp;Bug included a brief DEG tease. There was a humorous question and answer session between the band and audience during one of the commercial breaks. Studio versions of Birds, Bouncing, and Heavy Things were used as intros and outros for the commercials.",

The Mockingbird narration referenced the band&rsquo;s upcoming hiatus. I Didn&rsquo;t Know included a reference to Kid Rock&rsquo;s sidekick Joe C. Esther featured flubbed lyrics for the final verse, ending with Trey proclaiming: &ldquo;She died. Dead.&rdquo; As the band returned for the second set, the crowd serenaded Trey with Happy Birthday. Twist contained San-Ho-Zay teases from Trey. Emotional Rescue included a bizarre synchronized duel on-stage between Trey and Mike.

Earlier in the show, Phish had appeared in the recurring &ldquo;Jarret&rsquo;s Room&rdquo; sketch series, where Jimmy Fallon plays a college dorm room web-show host. In the sketch, the band was forced to hang out with Jarret&nbsp;and his friends after being involved in a car accident with one of them. Gore appeared in the sketch as one of the students&rsquo; professors. All four members of Phish joined in to play a snippet of Contact in the dorm room. Later, Robert Smigel&rsquo;s <em>TV Funhouse</em> cartoon parodied the ability of Charlie Brown and his <em>Peanuts</em> friends to transform and enliven anything (e.g., a dumpy Christmas tree) by just &ldquo;waving their arms around a lot.&rdquo; Phish appeared as the &ldquo;transformed&rdquo; version of Schroeder and his friends, who had been playing music themselves. During the cartoon, two pieces of You Enjoy Myself were used as the <em>Peanuts</em> characters danced around.",

    "shownotes": "Phish returned from their hiatus with their first public show since October 7, 2000. The pre-show music alluded to the end of the hiatus with such songs as the theme from <em>Welcome Back Kotter</em>, Feels Like the First Time, Back in the Saddle Again, Reunited, and The Boys are Back in Town. The final selection was Foreplay/Long Time, during which time the band took the stage. Piper included a Low Rider tease. Prior to Wilson, a scene from the Tom Hanks movie <em>Cast Away </em>was played in the arena (referring to Hanks&rsquo; character searching for his volleyball/companion named Wilson). Trey subsequently introduced Hanks to sing the final lyric. Major news media reported the Hanks appearance, but the guest singer was actually Page&rsquo;s brother, Steve McConnell. Mound was played for the first time since November 19, 1996 (276 shows). Bowie included a DEG tease. This show included the debuts of Waves, Seven Below and Walls of the Cave. Appropriately, Seven Below began about seven minutes before midnight. During the song, the crew lowered a disco ball from the scoreboard and created a &ldquo;snowfall&rdquo; on stage. Dancers dressed in white as snow creatures took the stage and circled the band before dispersing into the crowd. Some of the dancers ascended ladders and donned stilts to become snow angels. At midnight, white balloons and confetti were dropped on the crowd. A dwarf remained on each front corner of the stage, popping balloons, while the snow angels continued to dance. Runaway Jim contained a Weekapaug tease&nbsp;from Page. Time Loves&nbsp;a Hero was last&nbsp;played&nbsp;August 11, 1998&nbsp;(or 151 shows). Walls included a San-Ho-Zay tease from Trey.&nbsp;The evening was capped with perfect post-show music: Let&rsquo;s Stay Together.",

Trey teased San-Ho-Zay in YEM. One portion of the YEM vocal jam was based on the name &ldquo;George Takei&rdquo; (the actor who played Mr. Sulu on <em>Star Trek</em>) and another was based on the melody to Tweezer Reprise. Lyrics in Makisupa referenced &ldquo;fatty,&rdquo; &ldquo;Waffle House,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hooters.&rdquo; The end of Possum included bizarre on-stage antics with Page playing Trey&rsquo;s guitar from his seat, Trey playing Mike&rsquo;s bass, and Mike using the &ldquo;B&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ah&rdquo; cymbals normally reserved for Cracklin&rsquo; Rosie. This improvisational Contact continued the joke of mock introductions, as Trey introduced &ldquo;Al Gore.&rdquo;",

After a long pause, Trey commented, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re taking our sweet time up here because&hellip;we have no place to go for two days.&rdquo; DWD contained a San-Ho-Zay tease from Trey and multiple Scents and Subtle Sounds teases.&nbsp;NICU ended with a bass solo from Mike at Trey&rsquo;s request (&ldquo;Play it, Cactus!&rdquo;). Seven Below contained an On Your Way Down tease,&nbsp;Scents and Subtle Sounds included Seven Below teases. Before Dog Log, Trey remarked that the band couldn&rsquo;t figure out what to play, and noted how, on this tour, the band made a conscious effort to not think about what songs they were going to play next. The fourth set &ldquo;Tower Jam&rdquo; found Phish playing on top the old air traffic control tower near the concert field. The set consisted of roughly an hour&rsquo;s worth of unscripted jam material, with no notable teases or jams present. While Phish jammed, Chris Kuroda illuminated the tower&rsquo;s interior and exterior with a light show and dancers suspended by wires around the side of the tower performed on the structure.",

    "shownotes": "This was the second show of the IT festival. Chalk Dust contained DEG teases from Mike. The ending of Chalk Dust was performed at near double-time. Trey omitted a verse in Wilson. Afterwards, he announced that it was the &ldquo;shortest version ever&rdquo; and dedicated it to Phish archivist Kevin Shapiro. Trey then humorously announced that the band would next play the &ldquo;longest Bittersweet Motel&rdquo; (traditionally one of the shortest songs in the Phish canon) while Page teased &quot;Charge!&quot;&nbsp;The crowd responded with a passionate &ldquo;Fluffhead&rdquo; chant, but Trey responded: &ldquo;Mike says no&rdquo; (prompting laughs from the other band members). Appropriately, Trey launched into Mike&rsquo;s Song but Mike had the last laugh: during the Mike&rsquo;s Song intro, Mike sang his &ldquo;Hendge&rdquo; lyric that had been omitted from Wilson. Weekapaug included a Seven Below tease. YEM contained the event-appropriate lyrical change &ldquo;Boy, Man, God, IT,&rdquo; a Frankenstein tease from Mike, and a vocal quote of Daniel Saw the Stone. The band vamped on the theme to <em>Chariots of Fire</em> (a Phish debut) while Trey introduced the top finishers in the Runaway Jim 5K race. During Antelope, Trey thanked the staff, road crew, caterers (&ldquo;part of the reason we&rsquo;re playing so well is because we have the best food this tour that we&rsquo;ve ever had&rdquo;), and fans. He concluded by encouraging everyone to drive safely and noted tongue-in-cheek that next year&rsquo;s &ldquo;IT 2&rdquo; would have a traffic-free entrance. Antelope also included Under Pressure and It&rsquo;s Ice teases.",

Ya Mar contained teases of The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana). At the end of Disease, a video screen descended behind the stage. As the house lights remained down, a 25+ minute video was played featuring retrospective highlights from throughout Phish&rsquo;s career. Before the second set, Mike brought out a tray of desserts and shared them with fans in front of the stage. Highway to Hell was briefly teased by Trey before Rock and Roll. Weekapaug was unfinished. Tweezer Reprise included lyrics (sung by Trey) from Mike&rsquo;s Song. Appropriately, the post-show house music was the Beatles&rsquo; song Sgt.

    "shownotes": "<p>Wilson contained War Pigs teases from Mike and was unfinished. The song may have been played as an opener in memoriam of actor Earl Hindman, best known as &ldquo;Wilson&rdquo; from the television series <em>Home Improvement</em>, who passed away earlier in the day. NICU contained Shafty teases from Mike. Weigh was played for the first time since August 2, 1998 (200 shows). Cities included Sand teases. Gin included Show Biz Kids and After Midnight teases. 2001 included a P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up) jam containing some brief lyrics, as well as Gin, Sand,&nbsp;Auld Lang Syne, and The Little Drummer Boy teases. Tube was unfinished. L.A. Woman was a Phish debut; Birds included L.A. Woman teases. During Makisupa, Trey noted that they were going to play Touch Me, but decided not to because Fish couldn&#39;t remember the words and they didn&#39;t know how have a horn section. To make it up to the crowd for letting them down, Trey brought out George Clinton and Parliament/Funkadelic (also known as The P. Funk All-Stars). Trey commented&nbsp;&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s even<em> better</em> than Touch Me!&rdquo; Page teased Touch Me while Trey was talking. The ensuing P. Funk Jam moved through pieces of several classic Parliament/Funkadelic tunes including Butt-a-Butt, Give Up the Funk (Tear the Roof Off the Sucker), P. Funk (Wants to Get Funked Up), and One Nation Under A Groove. Get Low (Lil Jon and the Eastside Boyz) was also part of the medley. By the end of the jam, Fish&nbsp;was alone on stage playing vacuum. Fish then exited, leaving the stage empty. Phish returned alone to finish Makisupa; to prove that P. Funk was better than Fish&nbsp;singing Touch Me, Makisupa closed with Fish&nbsp;singing the first line of Touch Me <em>a cappella.</em> During the last chorus of Contact, Trey sang lines like &ldquo;L.A. Woman&rdquo; and &ldquo;Make my funk the P. Funk&rdquo; in place of his usual harmonies.</p>\r\n",

    "shownotes": "The brief conclusions of Wilson and Tube completed the versions from the previous evening. Weekapaug included Jungle Boogie lyrics and a Divided Sky tease; Weekapaug, YEM, First Tube, and Chalk Dust also included Auld Lang Syne teases. Seven Below was unfinished. The house music played over the P.A. during the second setbreak consisted solely of songs that referenced &ldquo;cars&rdquo; in their titles. As midnight neared during Jungle Boogie (a Phish debut), Fish&rsquo;s drum kit was wheeled to the side of the stage. An Austin Cooper Mini automobile was lowered to the stage from above. The Miami Palmetto Senior High Band and cheerleading squad emerged from the car one-by-one, giving the impression that they were all in the car together. In reality, the car had touched down over a trap door in the stage and the guests came out from underneath. Also emerging were dancers similar to the bunny-women present at the IT Festival. The marching band joined in on the jam that emerged from Jungle Boogie. With the stage covered with marching band members and dancers (some even on top of Page&rsquo;s baby grand piano), an emcee (dressed in an Eddie George, Tennessee Titans, #27 football jersey) counted the clock down to midnight. A massive balloon drop followed. Phish then led the marching band through an instrumental version of Iron Man (also a Phish debut). Reba did not have the whistling ending. For his &ldquo;first song of 2004,&rdquo; in honor of the Miami Heat, Fish&nbsp;performed the Phish debut of Feel the Heat, which contained Fame quotes from Trey and Fish.&nbsp;HYHU contained more references to &ldquo;Henrietta&rsquo;s Heat&rdquo; as Fish&nbsp;took laps around the stage. Frankenstein was preceded by a Fluffhead tease.",

This show marked Chris Kuroda&rsquo;s first absence from the light crew since April 2, 1989 (1,179&nbsp;shows). Disease was unfinished. Jennifer Hartswick assisted on vocals during Girls, a Jay-Z cover that made its Phish debut. Secret Smile featured a new arrangement.&nbsp; This was the first Sneakin&#39; Sally to contain a vocal jam since May 28, 1989 (1,150&nbsp;shows). The vocal jam led into a brief quote of Coconut.&nbsp; Trey then asked Fish&nbsp;if he was wearing his &ldquo;new suit,&rdquo; referring to his&nbsp;sonic dress. After Fish&nbsp;answered &ldquo;no,&rdquo; Trey went on to rap about how people would have to attend the following night to see Fish&nbsp;play it. The rap slid into a bit of free-form vocal jamming to close the show.",

As Fish&nbsp;took a drum solo, Trey set his guitar down to perform the Meatstick Dance while the crowd chanted the lyrics. The band jammed back into YEM, but then left Page to solo while again Trey danced and the crowd sang. This cycle repeated with Mike soloing on bass. YEM lacked its standard vocal jam. Trey rapped: &ldquo;time for the Meatstick&rdquo; over the intro to Tweezer Reprise, which also had its normal lyrics replaced with &ldquo;won&rsquo;t you step into the Meatstick?&rdquo; Wolfman&rsquo;s contained teases of Simple, Jean Pierre, Sneakin&rsquo; Sally, and Possum.",

Unfortunately, no one knew all of the words to Tears of a Clown, so they picked a member of the audience to come onstage and sing (prompting Trey to note, &ldquo;She saved our ass.&rdquo;). Tweezer contained a HYHU jam at the end (with Trey still on guitar and Fish on drums). During HYHU, Fish introduced himself as &ldquo;Prince&rdquo; and added some vacuum accompaniment. Before Terrapin, Trey joked, &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t be needing this anymore!&rdquo; and acted as if he was going to throw his guitar into the crowd, to a reception of lusty boos from the crowd. After Terrapin, Trey took an impromptu poll of the audience as to whether a Fishman tune makes the show or destroys the show, with Page notably coming in on the side of destroys the show, though softening the blow by explaining, &quot;Well, it&#39;s a crapshoot. Sometimes it&#39;s great, but sometimes... you wonder.&quot; Mike, more charitably, stated, &ldquo;On a scale of two to three, I give it a three.&rdquo; Before the Drums Jam with Trey and Fish, Trey noted that it had always been a dream of his to start a song with a double drum solo; this was the first known instance.",

Trey teased Waves in Halley&#39;s Comet. Before Bowie, Trey told a story of the summer he spent living in a cabin in the Northeast Kingdom where he remembered writing several songs, including Bowie. Trey explained that Bowie was an attempt to see &ldquo;how far can you push it in the harmonic and rhythmic language and still have people dancing.&rdquo; During Hood, Trey (speaking in rhythm) noted that because there were a row of rocks separating the band from the crowd, they were feeling a certain level of disconnect (particularly&nbsp;when Mike plays a &quot;sexy&quot; note). To remedy the situation, Trey and Mike ventured down onto the rocks for the duration of the song. At the end of Hood, the band stopped playing, allowing the audience to sing the &ldquo;You can feel good, good, good about Hood&rdquo; refrain.",

    "shownotes": "This was the second show of the Coventry festival and was the presumed &ldquo;Final Show.&rdquo;&nbsp;When Trey made his &ldquo;break-up&rdquo; announcement the preceding May, he indicated that Coventry would be the final Phish shows. In reality, this turned out to be the final public show for over four and a half years. This show was simulcast in movie theaters nationwide. Before Anything But Me, Trey announced that, for the first time in 21 years, he was nervous performing a Phish show. During Wolfman&rsquo;s, Trey revealed that the Wolfman&rsquo;s Brother is, in fact, Fish (as well as the fact that he handed the phone to his friend Liz Durfee). Also, during Wolfman&rsquo;s, Trey and Mike invited their mothers onstage (and later John Paluska) to do the &ldquo;sexy bump&rdquo; dance. Disease was unfinished and featured Trey briefly playing his guitar with a glow stick. Both Page and Trey broke down during an especially emotional Velvet Sea. After a thoroughly botched Glide, all four band members offered words of thanks to the fans for their continued support and dedication and brief reflections on their twenty years together. Trey then stated that what they really needed to do was &ldquo;blow off some fucking steam&rdquo; before starting up Melt. There was an enormous glow stick war during Ghost featuring hundreds, if not thousands, of orange glow sticks. This version of Seven Below saw all of the band members sporadically shouting &ldquo;Seven Below&rdquo; throughout the jam. The Phish debut of Cool Jerk contained alternate lyrics honoring monitor mixer, Mark &ldquo;Bruno&rdquo; Bradley. The Dickie Scotland Song was spontaneously created and included lyrics in honor of production manager, Hadden Hipsley, and tour accountant, Richard Glasgow (a.k.a. Dickie Scotland). Before Wilson, Trey asked the crowd to sing to another of their friends &ldquo;for the last time.&rdquo; There was a fireworks display between the end of the third set and the encore. Before the encore, while explaining the origins of The Curtain, Trey jokingly announced that the entire Chicago Symphony and the Twyla Tharp Dance Troupe were going to perform Gamehendge. Trey explained that they chose The Curtain With as the last song to bring them full circle, because, not only was it one of the first Phish songs he wrote, but he wrote it in a cabin one town over from Coventry. Trey stopped and restarted the jam segment of the Curtain With, because they were in the wrong key or, as he explained, &rdquo;Since we are going to be bringing ourselves back in time, we may as well do it in the correct key.&rdquo; There was no P.A. music after the Curtain With.",

Piper included a Spill the Wine tease from Page. This show featured the first Psycho Killer since December 7, 1997 (282 shows). Psycho Killer was unfinished and disintegrated into a self-described, electronic &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; jam. During the post-Psycho Killer &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; jam, Trey initiated a dance contest saying that whoever could best dance to that music would &ldquo;win something.&rdquo;&nbsp; After Catapult (while continuing the &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; jam), Trey asked, &ldquo;Does everybody else love this song as much as I do?&rdquo; and said that he was &ldquo;waiting for the day when they play stuff like this on the radio.&rdquo;&nbsp; Icculus was last performed on July 18, 1999 (193 shows). The Icculus narration centered on the fact that &ldquo;you crazy kids&rdquo; just don&rsquo;t read anymore.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Pong&rdquo; jam reappeared during the YEM jam. The soundcheck included a jam with lyrics that were made up on the fly with Trey on bass (so that Mike could check on bass sounds from the audience) and Fish on drums. Trey briefly quoted Spill the Wine and The Pendulum during the soundcheck jam.",

After Divided Sky, Trey acknowledged the beauty of the&nbsp;venue&nbsp;and announced that Page would now play a love song to the lawn since it was the first time they had played on grass&nbsp;in a long time.&nbsp;Antelope&#39;s lyrics were changed to &nbsp;&quot;Been you to have any Coil, man?&quot; (The Coil was an art installation on the venue grounds.)&nbsp;Set 2 began with a video highlighting selections of the 99 classic albums displayed and then systematically eliminated on the phish.com web site leading up to the festival. Selections in the montage included snippets from Michael Jackson&#39;s <em>Thriller</em>, T.Rex&#39;s <em>Electric Warrior</em>, Metallica&#39;s <em>Master of Puppets</em>, Miles Davis&#39;s <em>A Tribute to Jack Johnson</em>, Fleetwood Mac&#39;s <em>Rumours</em> and The Doors (self titled), among others. All of the <em>Exile on Main St</em>&nbsp;songs were Phish debuts, except for <a href=\"http://phish.net/song/loving-cup\">Loving Cup</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://phish.net/song/sweet-virginia\">Sweet Virginia</a>.&nbsp;All songs in the second set except for Casino Boogie, Torn and Frayed, and I Just Want To See His Face featured Dave Guy on trumpet, David Smith on trombone, and Tony Jarvis on saxophone. Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, and Loving Cup through Soul Survivor also featured Sharon Jones and Saundra Williams on backup vocals.&nbsp;Trey introduced the horn section after Tumbling Dice and again after the completion of the costume, before saying &quot;We are the Rolling Stones. See you later.&quot; Suzy Greenberg was played with Jones, Williams, and&nbsp;the horns. This show featured the first Sweet Virginia since September 26, 1999 (173 shows).",

The first set, which started at noon, was billed as Phish&#39;s &quot;first full-length acoustic set&quot; (complete with complimentary coffee and Festival 8 themed donuts). The first set featured Trey and Mike on acoustics, Page solely on piano, and a unique stage setup&nbsp;that had Fish&nbsp;stage right with Page on the far left. Before Brian and Robert, Trey encouraged the crowd to sit down due to the &quot;mellow&quot; nature of the set; he added that they had never before played to a crowd that was sitting. Whether the crowd should stand up or sit down became a running joke throughout the set, until Trey confessed during Wilson that he only asked the crowd to sit down at the request of the crew and, in fact, he hates telling people what to do (and also hates sitting down). This show marked the Phish debuts of Invisible and Sleep Again. Fish&nbsp;performed a whistle solo on My Sweet One. The band briefly left the stage after McGrupp, returning to encore with Driver, Talk, and Secret Smile. The second and third sets were played later that evening.&nbsp;Reba lacked the whistling ending. Trey took a moment before Tweeprise to thank those who helped put on the festival.",

Demand was played for the first time since November 14, 1996 (392 shows). NO2 was played for the first time since July 13, 1999 (219 shows). Prior to the third set, a pedestal stating 2010 was placed on the front of the stage and a covered structure was placed behind Fish&#39;s drumset. During DWD, as the clock turned midnight, hundreds of balloons were released upon the crowd, fireworks went off on each side of the stage, and a disco ball was lowered onto the pedestal. After DWD, Trey opened the ball and Fish&nbsp;climbed inside. Trey and Mike, with some help from stagehands, proceeded to put the ball in a giant cannon aimed towards a giant net hanging from the rafters with an illuminated &ldquo;X&rdquo; on it. Page hit the trigger and purportedly &quot;blasted&quot; the ball through, not only the net, but also the roof of the arena. A searchlight appeared to come through the roof and was accompanied by helicopter sounds. With Fish&nbsp;apparently shot out of the venue, Trey asked if anybody knew how to play the drums and ended up finding Sarah, a girl from Pittsburgh. Trey asked how long she had played the drums and what her favorite song was and she responded with six months and Fluffhead respectively. Sarah was surreptitiously replaced by Fish, now wearing a dress identical to Sarah&#39;s and a black wig, who played the entire third set and encore, but Sarah came out at the end of the third set and bowed with the band instead of him. Blue Moon was a Phish debut and was performed as an instrumental while Trey thanked the entire crew. After the show, the disco ball was revealed to have &quot;crashed&quot; into a white car that had been parked in front of the American Airlines Arena with a sign on the windshield stating &quot;This car was driven down from Vermont&quot; and &quot;fueled by maple syrup.&quot; &nbsp;After being &ldquo;struck&rdquo; by the &ldquo;human cannonball,&rdquo; the car was emitting smoke and leaking maple syrup and the entire area was cordoned off with police tape.&nbsp;",

The incomplete versions of Heartbreaker, Thank You, and Stairway to Heaven were all Phish debuts. Ramble On was played for the first time since August 12, 1998 (305 shows). After Stairway to Heaven, Trey joked, &quot;Happy Halloween! See you all next year.&quot; Mike teased The Lemon Song before Halley&#39;s. Appropriately, Whole Lotta Love was also the post-show music. From the soundcheck, Ramble On and the second and third versions of Whole Lotta Love were incomplete. Destiny Unbound was played by only Mike and Fish, started out as being sung to the drumbeat of Time Loves A Hero and included a Live and Let Die quote from Mike.",

The second set &quot;musical costume&quot; was Little Feat&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Waiting for Columbus</em>. Join the Band (the first track of&nbsp;<em>Waiting for Columbus</em>)<em>&nbsp;</em>was played over the P.A. before the start of the second set. &nbsp;Subsequently, Phish was introduced as &quot;Little Feat&quot; before Fat Man in the Bathtub. In the tradition of some of Phish&#39;s previous crowd experiments in the early &#39;90s, flyers explaining a new Secret Language prank were included in the Phishbills that were passed out to fans as they walked into the show. The prank, designed to confuse those who would later listen to the recording, consisted of an announcer introducing Phish (as Little Feat). When the announcer would say a letter of the band FEAT (&quot;Give me an F!&quot;), the crowd would respond with letters corresponding to PHISH (&quot;P-H!&quot;). All of the songs in the second set other than Time Loves a Hero were Phish debuts. All of the songs in the second set, other than Don&#39;t Bogart That Joint and Willin&#39;, featured Giovanni Hidalgo on percussion. A five piece horn section consisting of Aaron Johnson, Stuart Bogie, Ian Hendrickson-Smith, Michael Leonhart and Eric Biondo joined the band for Old Folks Boogie, Time Loves a Hero, Day or Night, Mercenary Territory, Spanish Moon, Dixie Chicken, Rocket in My Pocket and Feats Don&#39;t Fail Me Now. Willin&#39; featured Page on bass, Mike on piano, Trey on drums and Fish on vocals. Prior to the piano solo at the beginning of Willin&#39;, Fish remarked, &quot;That&#39;s supposed to be Bill Payne on the keyboard.&quot; Don&#39;t Bogart That Joint was performed <em>a cappella</em>. Trey introduced the guest musicians at the start of Feats Don&#39;t Fail Me Now and Page teased &quot;Charge!&quot; during the introductions. At the conclusion of the second set, the entire band marched the perimeter of the floor. Disease was unfinished, was initially botched, and had to be restarted, prompting Fish to declare, &quot;This one&#39;s off <em>our </em>album.&quot; Julius featured Giovanni Hidalgo and the <em>Waiting for Columbus</em>&nbsp;horn section.",

An amp (with the steam kettle on it), a keytar, a bass, a vacuum, and a few lights were then lifted off the stage. A woman in the front of the stage tossed a &ldquo;Steam&rdquo; sign into the front row, then rose with a barricade and security guard before eventually being lifted up over the band. Several other aerialists (clothed in various casual attire, equipped with black backpacks emitting smoke and lights on their backs) subsequently rose up from the crowd and ascended and descended several times. The first aerialist counted down to midnight, at which point balloons were released from the ceiling. The aerialists later returned with lights in their hands for Down with Disease, which also featured Trey and Mike being raised up and back down a few times before finally rising several feet on hydraulic lifts. Steam contained a Spooky tease from Trey and Disease was unfinished.",

He answered the question by saying the songs were My Friend, My Friend, Rift, and Brother (all of which had their endings &quot;sung&quot;). Trey added that tonight was special because from now on, Timber would also end with the Brother ending (which was sung again). Trey said Page could also end Lawn Boy that way from now on, prompting a Lawn Boy quote from Page. Mike then teased Ha Ha Ha. Trey went on to say that Metallica would be playing at Bader Field soon after Phish and that he didn&#39;t think they ended a single song like the ending of Brother (Trey sang the ending). Trey said if everyone wrote Metallica a note saying &quot;Dear Metallica, please end Master of Puppets like this&quot; (singing the ending one final time), if they got 20,000 notes, they just might do it.

Antelope included alternate lyrics &quot;Been you to tuck in your dress, man?&quot; &quot;Tuck, tuck, tuck, tuck&quot; and&nbsp;&quot;Tuck in your dress man, you&#39;re out of control!&quot; Trey also said that for 30 years, Fish has been leaving his dress untucked and told everybody to tuck in their dresses. Mike, Trey, and Page tucked in their shirts before the setbreak bow. Split Open and Melt included the alternate lyrics &quot;Split open and tuck.&quot; Backwards Down the Number Line contained a DEG tease from Trey.

And that one too. But the force is strong with that one.&quot; &nbsp;The audience was subsequently called out by Fish, Trey, and Page, in part being told repeatedly &quot;You suck at tucking&quot; over the Maze intro. The Maze intro also featured Trey asking Chris Kuroda to turn off the lights while he waved the light saber around, talked like Darth Vader, saying &quot;I am your father, Fish. I am your father,&quot; and played the guitar with his light saber.

Prior to the show, actors played garden sports including croquet, badminton, and mini-golf, while a few more &quot;sunbathed&quot; on a riser behind the stage. During the first setbreak, golfers came on stage and hit soft golf balls into the crowd. &nbsp;Light contained an Auld Lang Syne tease. &nbsp;You Enjoy Myself contained a Birds of a Feather tease. &nbsp;Trey, Page and Mike came out for the third set in golf carts and began hitting golf balls into the crowd. Fish&nbsp;then arrived on a golf cart wearing donut pants and shirt, an argyle vest, and a golf hat. &nbsp;Golf carts were brought back on stage during Kung, then began racing past the stage periodically during Chalk Dust. During the Chalk Dust jam, golfers began getting out of the carts, hitting balls into the crowd and dancing on stage. &nbsp;One of the golfers did the New Year&#39;s countdown from on top of a cart. &nbsp;Auld Lang Syne was accompanied by balloons dropping from the ceiling and ping pong balls fired from cannons. &nbsp;Tweezer Reprise featured Carrie Manolakos on vocals and a number of backup singers. The remainder of the third set and encore featured song titles focusing on a golf theme. Wilson was preceded by an animated Wilson golf ball on the venue&#39;s jumbotrons. Iron Man was preceded by Page coming to the front of the stage to wish the crowd Happy New Year and reference the start of the 30th year of Phish. In an apparent reference to Bob Hope, Page wore a blazer, USS Nimitz ball cap and carried a golf club. Driver was stopped and restarted.This show featured the Phish debuts of Garden Party and Fly Like an Eagle, the first full Phish performance of Iron Man (which was last played December 31, 2003, or 192 shows), and the first ever <em>a cappella</em> Lawn Boy.",

Following The Horse, the band acted as if the show was over&nbsp;before starting to play Silent in the Morning. Trey then explained that by pretending to not play Silent and end the show, they were making a joke, given their not playing The Horse to precede Silent in recent versions.&nbsp;Having to explain this &quot;joke&quot; prompted Trey to tell the story of performing In A&nbsp;Hole back in the 1980s. Fish suggested they play In A Hole, but Trey said he could not remember it. He agreed to sing the chorus, however, and sang part of it briefly (emphasizing&nbsp;the pun on the &quot;a hole&quot; lyric)&nbsp;while Fish and Page played a small&nbsp;part of the music of the song&#39;s chorus. &quot;It&#39;s just as funny as it was 30 years ago,&quot; Page noted. &quot;Thank you for laughing.&quot; Fluffhead contained a Dave&#39;s Energy Guide tease.",

The musical costume was a set of original, mostly instrumental music played with the sound effects and narration of the 1964 Disneyland album <em>Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House</em>. Prior to the start of Set II, the stage was cleared of all band equipment, and a graveyard set was brought out. At the start of the set, smoke filled the stage, and zombies appeared behind the gate. When the gate opened, a large haunted house with the band inside was brought to the front of the stage. The sound effects and narration were played on the PA, while an undead narrator would emerge from a crypt inscribed with &quot;ESTHER&quot;&nbsp;prior to each song for&nbsp;the introduction. At the end of The Fuse, the sides of the house came down while sounds of an explosion were heard, and the band was revealed inside, dressed in white tuxedoes and with zombie face paint. Several zombies came to the front of the stage and danced during Martian Monster. At the conclusion of the set, the band members came down from the Haunted House riser, slowly walked to the front of the stage, and took bows, along with the entire cast of zombies. All songs during the second set were debuts, with the titles taken from the first ten tracks of <em>Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House</em>. Sand contained a tease by Trey&nbsp;of School&#39;s Out.&nbsp;Is This What You Wanted&nbsp;was a Phish debut.

The song was then stopped because, Trey said, the vacuum had become stuck to Fish&#39;s face. Brian Brown and Lee Scott (Trey&#39;s guitar tech and Fish&#39;s drum tech respectively) came out to assist in trying to remove the vacuum and then went behind the stage with Fish to fix the problem, with Mike suggesting they switch it &quot;from suck to blow.&quot; There was the sound of a small explosion and the lights went out. A giant inflatable Fishman then emerged from behind the stage and took off over the crowd, while the balloon drop, including Henrietta donut balloons,&nbsp;occurred and the band played Auld Lang Syne. Trey quoted Martian Monster during his speech at the end of Julius.",

Just A Touch began with Trey on acoustic guitar accompanied by James, Jennifer, and Natalie on vocals in a stairwell in the Beacon and finished with them all on stage. Pebbles and Marbles, Slave to the Traffic Light, and First Tube featured The Rescue Squad Strings (Katie Kresek and Maxim Moston on violin, Rachel Golub on viola, and Anja Wood on cello) with&nbsp;Pebbles and Slave&nbsp;beginning&nbsp;with&nbsp;just Trey on acoustic guitar with The Rescue Squad Strings and the TAB horns before Trey switched&nbsp;to electric guitar and the rest of the band joined&nbsp;in. Liquid Time was stopped (for Trey to talk) and restarted. Trey briefly sang Moby Dick before Shine. Trey quoted Baby Blue after Shine. After First Tube, Trey walked through the Beacon into the lobby (where there were dancers), giving facemasks out to people before exiting the Beacon with the music still playing.</p>\r\n",
